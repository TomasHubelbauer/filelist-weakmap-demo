# `FileList` `WeakMap` demostration

Attempting to reproduce an issue I came across at work.

How to reproduce (note that the uploading is simulated with delays):

- Open `index.html` in your browser (as a file via the `file:` protocol is fine)
- Select multiple files using the `input[type="file]`
- Wait for the first selected file to start uploading
- Cancel the second file as the first one is uploading
- Wait for the first file's faux-upload to finish
- Observe no other files following the one that was canceled start uploading

The last step doesn't actually happen, but first:

Initially my hunch was that when removing the corresponding entry from `uplads`,
the `File` instance gets garbage collected, because there is no other reference
to it any longer, which breaks the `FileList`'s iterator and it short-circuits,
whereas with an indexer-based enumeration, there is no underlying collection
being mutated and hence, that works.

I've prototyped both solutions here though, and they both workâ€¦
So now I'm left scratching my head what was it that actually was going wrong at
work and why changing from an iterator-based access to an indexed-based one made
it work.
